## Why use classes?

1. Increased readability and code clarity: Classes provide a clearer and more readable syntax for defining objects and their behavior. Instead of using constructor functions and prototypes, which can be harder for novice programmers to understand, classes offer an easier way to create and maintain code.

2. Facilitates the creation of similar objects: Classes allow for the creation of similar objects through code reuse. A class can act as a model for creating many similar objects with common properties and behaviors.

3. Fewer errors and better encapsulation: Classes in ES6 provide an additional level of encapsulation for code, meaning that the properties and methods of the class are kept private and protected from other code. This helps prevent errors in the code, as access to the properties and methods of the class is more effectively controlled.

4. Improved functionality: Classes in ES6 offer new functionality that was not available in previous versions of JavaScript. This includes static methods, which can be invoked on the class itself instead of having to instantiate an object of the class, making the code more efficient.

## Class

Classes are an easier and cleaner way to create objects and define their behavior in JavaScript.

A class is defined using the class syntax, followed by the class name. To create an object from a class, we use the new keyword and call the class constructor.

In addition to instance properties and methods, we can also define class properties and methods in a class. Class methods are defined using the static keyword.

## Static methods
Static methods are methods that belong to a class rather than an instance of the class.
This means that, unlike instance methods, you don't need to create an instance of the class in order to call a static method. Instead, you can call the static method directly from the class.
An example of a static method would be a method that performs a simple mathematical operation, such as adding two numbers. This method doesn't need to access any internal state of the class instance, so it can be declared as a static method.
To declare a static method in most object-oriented programming languages, you need to use the keyword "static" before the method name.

In summary, static methods are methods that belong to a class rather than an instance of the class and can be called directly from the class without the need to create an instance.
