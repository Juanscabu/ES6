## Anonymous Functions
1. They have no name: As the name suggests, anonymous functions do not have an assigned name. This means that they cannot be called directly by their name, but instead must be used as arguments for other functions or assigned to variables.
2. They are defined as expressions: Anonymous functions are defined as expressions, which means they can be assigned to variables or used as arguments for other functions.
3. They can be used as callbacks: Anonymous functions are commonly used as callbacks (functions passed as arguments to other functions) in user events, server requests, animations, and other asynchronous operations.
4. Their scope is limited: Like any other function in JavaScript, an anonymous function has its own lexical scope, which means it can only access variables defined in its scope and global variables.
In summary, anonymous functions are nameless functions that are used as expressions and as arguments for other functions. They are useful for performing asynchronous operations, such as callbacks in user events and server requests, and have their own lexical scope.

## Concise Methods
Concise methods are a feature introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) that allows defining object methods in a more concise and readable way.

## Arrow Functions
Arrow Functions have the same functionality as regular JavaScript functions, but their syntax is more compact and designed to be easier to read and write. They are especially useful for maintaining the context of 'this' and reducing the amount of code needed to define a function.
