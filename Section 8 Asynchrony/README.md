## Promises
Promises in ES6 are a way of working with asynchronous operations in JavaScript that is easier and more efficient than with callbacks. A Promise is an object that represents a value that may be available now, in the near future, or never.

Instead of passing callback functions to handle the success or failure of an asynchronous operation, as you would with callbacks, Promises allow you to chain functions to handle the success or failure of the operation.

The Promise has three possible states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. When you create a Promise, it starts in the "pending" state. At this point, the Promise can be resolved with a value, which will change it to the "fulfilled" state, or rejected with a reason, which will change it to the "rejected" state.

To create a Promise, you must use the syntax of the Promise class. The Promise class takes a function as an argument, which in turn takes two arguments: resolve and reject. resolve is used to resolve the Promise with a value, while reject is used to reject the Promise with a reason.

For example, to create a Promise that resolves with the number 42, you can do the following:

const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve(42);
});
Once a Promise is resolved or rejected, you can chain functions using the then() and catch() methods. The then() method takes a function as an argument that will execute if the Promise is resolved, while the catch() method takes a function as an argument that will execute if the Promise is rejected.

For example, to chain a function that prints the value of the Promise if it is resolved, you can do the following:

myPromise.then((value) => {
  console.log(value); // will print "42"
});
And if you wanted to chain a function that handles the rejection of the Promise, you can do the following:

myPromise.catch((reason) => {
  console.log(`An error has occurred: ${reason}`);
});
In summary, Promises in ES6 are a way of working with asynchronous operations in JavaScript that is easier and more efficient than with callbacks. Promises have three possible states (pending, fulfilled, and rejected) and allow you to chain functions to handle the success or failure of an operation. You can create a Promise using the Promise class and chain functions using the then() and catch() methods.

## Callbacks
Callbacks in JavaScript are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and that are executed when an asynchronous operation is completed. Callbacks are used to handle the result of an asynchronous operation, such as an HTTP request, a file read/write operation, etc.

The idea behind callbacks is that, instead of waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete before continuing the execution of the program, you can provide a function that will be called when the operation is completed.

To use a callback, you must first define the function that will be called when the asynchronous operation is completed. Then, you must pass this function as an argument to the function that performs the asynchronous operation.

For example, if you wanted to make an HTTP request and handle the result using a callback, you could do the following:

function handleResponse(response) {
  // do something with the response
}

function handleResponse(response) {
  // do something with the response
}

function makeRequest(callback) {
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (this.readyState === 4 && this.status === 200) {
      callback(this.responseText);
    }
  };
  request.open("GET", "https://example.com");
  request.send();
}

makeRequest(handleResponse);
In this example, we first define the handleResponse function that will be called when the HTTP request is completed. Then, we define the makeRequest function that makes the HTTP request and calls the callback passed as an argument when the request is completed. Finally, we call the makeRequest function and pass the handleResponse function as an argument.

In summary, callbacks in JavaScript are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed when an asynchronous operation is completed. Callbacks are used to handle the result of an asynchronous operation and allow the program to continue execution without waiting for the operation to complete.

## Async and Await
The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function that returns a Promise. An asynchronous function can contain asynchronous operations, such as HTTP requests or file read/write operations, and can use the await keyword to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete before continuing the function execution.

For example, here is an asynchronous function that makes an HTTP request using the axios library and returns the result as a Promise:

async function makeRequest() {
  const response = await axios.get("https://example.com");
  return response.data;
}
In this example, we use the async keyword to define the makeRequest function as asynchronous. Then, we use the await keyword to wait for the HTTP request to complete and store the response in the response variable. Finally, we return the response data as a Promise.

When calling an asynchronous function that uses the await keyword, the function execution is halted until the asynchronous operation is completed. If the asynchronous operation is resolved successfully, the value returned by the Promise is assigned to the variable following the await keyword. If the asynchronous operation is rejected with an error, an exception is thrown that can be caught with a try...catch block.

For example, here is code that calls the makeRequest function and handles the result using a try...catch block:

async function handleResponse() {
  try {
    const data = await makeRequest();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

In this example, we call the makeRequest function using the await keyword and handle the result using a try...catch block. If the HTTP request is completed successfully, the data returned by the Promise is printed to the console. If the HTTP request is rejected with an error, the error is printed to the console.

In summary, Async and Await are features of JavaScript that allow working with asynchronous operations in a more simple and easy-to-understand way. The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function that returns a Promise. The await keyword is used inside an asynchronous function to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete before continuing the function execution.
